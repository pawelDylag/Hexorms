    <string name="info"><![CDATA[<b>Simulation</b> is about creating worms, in a board of hexes, which can move in randomly chosen direction.
        Each time worm steps into the hex where bacteria is on worm life will be expanded. Otherwise worm will loose one unit of health.
        After gaining maximum of health units the worm will expand into two. When health pool is equal to 0 worm dies. Simulation lasts until all worms are dead.
        <br><b>The board</b> makes a whole. Worm can go from top to bottom and from right to left.<br><br>
        <b>Board size:</b> choose a board size of simulation, you can set width and height from 3 to 18 hexes long.<br><br>
        <b>Worm count:</b> set number of worms that will appear randomly on the board. The number of worms can be equal from 1 to half area of the board.<br><br>
        <b>Bacteria factor:</b> set the possibility of bacteria appearance in each and every hex of the board.]]></string>
